# Advanced operating systems projects for computer engineering students

> _The main goal of this repository is to understand how different operating systems work through learning the basic operating systems fundamentals ,and understanding the role of each module so you are able to implement it by yourself;_


## 1. Unix shell

**_Unix shell:_ the command line interface in Linux/Unix operating system**
>_The goal here is to implement the Unix shell command line interface by yourself and add extra features if you want._

## 2. Synchronization
>_The goal of this project is to apply your knowledge of threads synchronization on Bidirectional autonomous trollies (carts) to control the resource i.e: streets yielding for the 4 trollies moving in the four directions: **North, South, East, West** by using semaphores and mutexlocks_

## 3. Pthreads
>_The goal of this project is to understand how threads work through implementing popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones i.e: Quicksort, Matrix multiplication, etc._
