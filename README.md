# Advanced operating systems projects for computer engineering students

> _The main goal of this repository is to understand how different operating systems work through learning the basic operating systems fundamentals ,and understanding the role of each module to be able to implement it by yourself_


## Unix shell

**_Unix shell_: the command line interface in Linux/Unix operating system**
>_The goal here is to implement the Unix shell command line interface by yourself and add extra features if you want_

## Synchronization
>_The goal of this project is to apply your knowledge of threads synchronization on Bidirectional autonomous trolley manager to control the resource (streets) yielding for the 4 trollies moving in the four directions: **North, South, East, West** by using semaphores and mutexlocks_

## Pthreads
>_The goal of this project is to understand how threads work through implementing popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones_
