# Advanced operating systems projects for computer science students

> _The main goal of this repo is to understand how operating systems work through learning the basic operating system fundamentals and understanding the role of each program to be able to implement it by  yourself_


## Unix shell

**_Unix shell_: the command line interface in linux/unix operating system**
>_The goal is to implement the unix shell command line interface by yourself and add extra features if possible_

## Synchronization
>_The goal is to apply your knowledge of threads synchronization on Bidirectional autonomous trolley manager by using  semaphores and mutexlocks_

## Pthreads
>_The goal is to understand how threads work through implementing famous algorithms as multi-threaded ones_
